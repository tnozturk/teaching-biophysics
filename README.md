# Teaching-Biophysics
"Teaching Biophysics" will host a collection of syllabi of biophysics courses around the world! Some biophysicists, including me, felt that it would be a good idea to create a database of biophysics course syllabi. We hope that this database can help us standardize learning outcomes and scope of biophysics courses at different levels. 
If you are interested in sharing your syllabus with us, please send an email to ozturk1@llnl.gov.
