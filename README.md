# teaching-biophysics
A collection of syllabi of biophysics courses around the world! Some biophysicists, including me, felt that it would be a good idea to create a database of biophysics course syllabi. We hope that this database can help us standardize learning outcomes and scope of biophysics courses at different levels.
