# Teaching-Biophysics

"Teaching Biophysics" will host a collection of  biophysics course syllabi, with the hope that this database of biophysics course syllabi can help standardization of learning outcomes and scope of biophysics courses at different levels. If you are planning to teach a biophysics course for the first time, it can help you finalize the list of topics you would like to cover in your course.

If you are interested in sharing your syllabus here, please send an email to ozturk1@llnl.gov.

## 001.The Physics of Life

A course for non-science-major undergraduates

**Syllabus:** Shared by Dr. Raghuveer Parthasarathy named as [001.ThePhysicsOfLife_Parthasarathy_Winter2018.pdf](https://github.com/tnozturk/teaching-biophysics/blob/main/syllabi/001.PhysicsOfLife_Parthasarathy_Winter2018.pdf)

**List of topics:**
 
- Introduction, Motivation, and Illustrations
- Scale and Powers of 10 – In which we get a sense of the size of things
- DNA mechanics – In which we examine the physical properties of life’s most important molecule, and why they matter
- Proteins – In which we examine the shapes of proteins, and how their shapes are determined
- Soap films, cell membranes – In which we examine similarities between the two, and also look more generally at materials that assemble themselves.
- Randomness and diffusion – In which we explore the perpetual motion of small things, both its unavoidable causes and its far-reaching consequences
- Life at Low Reynolds Number – In which we ask: Why don’t bacteria swim like whales?
- Microscopy – In which we ask: How can we see small things?
- Surfaces and surface tension – In which we explore the consequences of surface tension on the functioning of your lungs and ask: why can’t you walk on water
- On size and shape– In which we ponder how size and shape of can affect an organism’s properties

**Learning outcomes:** Upon completing the course, students will have enhanced their abilities to:

- understand how physical principles guide and constrain life;
- assess and interpret graphs and quantitative data;
- understand the process by which science generates knowledge.

**Typical classroom size and background of students:** About 50 students; non-science-major undergraduates

**Prerequisites:** None

**Resources:** None

**Notes:** Dr. Parthsarathy's new pop-science-biophysics book, So Simple a Beginning: How Four Physical Principles Shape Our Living World (2022), would be an appropriate resource for the course, supplemented with exercises. Dr. Parthsarathy mentioned that a few articles from Scientific American and other popular sources were assigned.

## 002. Introduction to Biophysics

A graduate course

**Syllabus:**  Shared by Dr. Raghuveer Parthasarathy named as [002.IntroductionToBiophysics_Parthasarathy_Fall2020.pdf](https://github.com/tnozturk/teaching-biophysics/blob/main/syllabi/002.IntroductionToBiophysics_Parthasarathy_Fall2020.pdf)

**List of topics:** 

- INTRODUCTION; PHYSICS, STATISTICS, AND SIGHT: What are the fundamental limits on vision, and how close does biology come to reaching them? (A brief look)
- COMPONENTS OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS: What are the components of biological systems? What are the length, time, and energy scales that we’ll care about?
- PROBABILITY AND HEREDITY: We’ll review concepts in probability and statistics. We’ll discuss a classic example of how a quantitative understanding of probability revealed how inheritance and mutation are related.
- RANDOM WALKS: We can make sense of a remarkable array of biophysical processes, from the diffusion of molecules to the swimming strategies of bacteria to the conformations of biomolecules, by understanding the properties of random walks.
- LIFE AT LOW REYNOLDS NUMBER: We’ll figure out why bacteria swim, and why they don’t swim like whales.
- ENTROPY, ENERGY, AND ELECTROSTATICS: We’ll see how entropy governs electrostatics in water, the “melting” of DNA, phase transitions in membranes, and more.
- MECHANICS IN THE CELL: We’ll look more at the mechanical properties of DNA, membranes, and other cellular components, and also learn how we can measure them.
- CIRCUITS IN THE CELL: Cells sense their environment and perform computations using data they collect. How can cells build switches, memory elements, and oscillators? What physical principles govern these circuits?
- COOL THINGS EVERYONE SHOULD BE AWARE OF: We live in an age in which we can shine a laser at neurons in a live animal to stimulate it, paste genes into any organism we wish, and read the genetic information in a single cell. It would be tragic to be ignorant of these almost magical things, and they contain nice physics as well!


**Learning outcomes:** Upon completing the course, students will have enhanced their abilities to:

- understand the physical principles that govern the function of important biological phenomena such as DNA packaging, bacterial motion, membrane deformation, and gene regulation;
- apply statistical and statistical-mechanical ideas to a wide variety of complex systems;
- read contemporary papers in biophysics and follow the aims and approaches.

**Typical classroom size and background of students:** About 6-12 students; mostly physics graduate students; about 1 chemistry or biology student each time

**Prerequisites: ** A good knowledge of undergraduate physics (especially statistical mechanics) and a corresponding adeptness with math. No prior knowledge of biology

**Resources:** No mandatory resource, excerpts from the following books:

- Biological Physics by Philip Nelson
- Physical Models of Living Systems by Philip Nelson,
- Physical Biology of the Cell by Rob Phillips, Jane Kondev, Hernan Garcia & Julie Theriotand
- Biophysics: Searching for Principles by William Bialek
