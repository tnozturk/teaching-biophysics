# Teaching-Biophysics

"Teaching Biophysics" will host a collection of syllabi of biophysics courses around the world! I hope that this database of biophysics course syllabi can help us standardize learning outcomes and scope of biophysics courses at different levels and/or help biophysicist decide the list of topics they'd like to cover in their own courses.

If you are interested in sharing your syllabus here, please send an email to ozturk1@llnl.gov.
